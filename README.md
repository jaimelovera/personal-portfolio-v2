# Online Portfolio - Version 2

###### Note: This is not up to date. I'm no longer updating this project.

> The second iteration of my online portfolio.

## Motivation

I wanted a place to share all of my personal projects and to provide more information about myself and my passions.

In the future I plan to redesign this website using React and a database to make this easier to maintain and update. And maybe add a blog!
